# AWS IoT SiteWise Conversational Agent

The AWS IoT SiteWise conversational agent is an agent-based implementation of the AWS IoT SiteWise API. This implementation leverages Agents for Amazon Bedrock.

This agent allows chatbots to provide users not only with information extracted from corporate knowledge bases but also with the operational state of their industrial assets without having to go to external industrial automation products (e.g., HMI, historian).
